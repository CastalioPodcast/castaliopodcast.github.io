Olá pessoal e sejam bem-vindos à mais um episódio do Castálio Podcast!

Today, we are going to be talking about one of the new programming languages
that have attracted attention from programmers and companies around the world.
Presented by [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org/) as a \"Safe,
Practical and Concurrent\" solution and with the promise of solving known
systems programming problems, [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is also a
multi-paradigm and multi-purpose language. And we\'ll learn more about
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) with [Carol Nichols](http://carol-nichols.com/)
one of its core-developers and author of [The Rust Programming
Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book.

# Discussed topics

1)  What is [Rust](http://rust-lang.org), Why does it exist? and how
    does it compare with other systems programming languages such as C++, D and
    Go?
2)  To ensure memory safety, avoid segmentation faults and race
    conditions, Rust brings a new level of complexity with the new concerns
    regarding lifetimes, [Ownership and
    Borrowing](https://rufflewind.com/2017-02-15/rust-move-copy-borrow). How to
    explain that stuff in an easy way?
3)  The plans to add syntax sugars to make writing Rust code easier.
4)  The [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/) package manager and the
    challenges of maintaining [crates.io](https://crates.io/) repository.
5)  The diversity of packages available on
    [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
6)  Some Rust pitfalls as the lack of learning resources for beginners
    and the long time taken to compile + the size of the binaries.
7)  Rust Market Share, [who is
    using](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html) and what are
    the known use cases.
8)  What is missing on Rust to hit the same popularity and adoption as
    Go?
9)  How to get started with [Rust](http://rust-lang.org)?
10) The future and what is coming from the [impl
    period](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/18/impl-future-for-rust.html)?
