We went through the following topics:

* How did he get started with computers?
* How did he get started with Python?
* What he likes most on the Python language?
* What led him to write his book, `Python Tricks`_?
* What sets his book apart from other books? In other words, why yet another
  book about Python?
* What tools does he use to write his book? And what tools he uses to ease the
  publishing process?
* A lot of the topics covered in Dan's book `Python Tricks`_ have been shared
  as videos on YouTube for free and he has a considerable following on YouTube.
  What led him to share this content with the public?
* Speaking of YouTube content, your videos are, in our humble opinion, really
  well put together and their content are always easy to follow and understand.
  How much time do you spend creating content for YouTube?
* What tools does he use for video editing and recording?
* What does he think about the future of Python?
* Are there some other courses or training material that he has developed.
* Just recently he started a new project called `PythonistaCafe`_, which sounds
  like a great combination (Python + coffee). He has described it as: “an
  invite-only, online community of Python and software development enthusiasts
  helping each other succeed and grow.” What is this project and what his goals
  are?
* What does he like to do while not writing a great book, creating great
  courses and releasing great videos? In other words, what he like to do while
  not in front of the PC?
