Olá pessoal e sejam bem-vindos à mais um episódio do Castálio Podcast!

Nosso convidado de hoje é o criador do Python Requests: HTTP para Humanos,
atualmente trabalha no Heroku com um título bem interessante, PythonOverLord,
possui uma coleção incrível de fotos no Instagram, e possui seu próprio Import
This podcast. Ele também escreveu o "Hitchhiker's Guide to Python", um livro de
boas práticas em Python que foi, coincidentemente publicado pela O'Reilly em
Setembro e todo o lucro das vendas está sendo doado para a fundação Django
Girls. Alem disso, possui muito projetos interessantes em sua página no Github.
É com grande prazer que trazemos uma entrevista, em inglês, com o Kenneth
Reitz.

Vamos fazer um post um pouco diferente hoje, fizemos a apresentação em
português e, de agora em diante, o post será todo em inglês. Por favor,
deixe-nos comentários sobre o que achou desse formato de post.

Hello everyone and welcome to Castálio Podcast!

Our guest for today's episode is the creator of Python Requests: HTTP for
Humans, currently works at Heroku with a pretty cool title, PythonOverLord, has an
amazing collection of pictures on his Instagram feed, hosts his own Import This
podcast. He also wrote the "Hitchhiker's Guide to Python", which is a Python
Best Practices Guidebook (which coincidentally was just published recently by
O’Reilly in September and all proceeds from sales are being donated directly to
the Django Girls Foundation!) and many other interesting projects which can be
seen by visiting his Github profile page. It is with great pleasure that we
welcome Kenneth Reitz to our podcast!

We all know Kenneth from his great programming skills and great Python
libraries, but maybe not everyone know how he started programming. As you
can imagine, we had to talk about that. We started talking about how he started
programming and his first projects. He told us about `SplashWear`_, which
was his very first user-facing software. SplashWear features:

* A glorious splash screen.
* A pc-speaker theme song.
* A colored DOS shell with customizable prompt.
* A glimpse into the matrix.
* Lots of easter eggs.

The project is available on Github at `kennethreitz/SlashWear`_ and, thanks for
the folks over at the Internet Archive, you can `run SplashWear in your web
browser`_

Next we talked about how he started programming in Python. It was interesting to
hear that he was in doubt between Computer Science, Photograph and Music. Thankfully,
to us, he picked Computer Science and decided to do Photograph and Music on the
side. He had his first Python experience on the Computer Science course. He
liked everything about Python but Classes, as he got stuck on understanding how
it works. He continued studying Python and, suddenly, one day, everything made
sense about Python.

We then talked about how Kenneth is involved with other communities and
other programming languages. Basically he is only involved with Python
community and he stressed that he really cares about Python currently. Then we
talked about his cool title at Heroku as PythonOverLord (not PythonLord as we
thought) and what that means as a role. Then he told us how he finds time to
take pictures and the good news is that he works from home and that helps him
find time to take those pictures, which makes him relax and be a better worker.

It could not be an episode with Kenneth if we did not talk about Python
Requests. We talked about how Python Requests started and how it evolved into
what it is today. It is worth to mention that Kenneth is really thankful for
all the love Requests receives and the importance it has to the community. We from
Castálio Podcast, and we hope our listeners too, are very thankful to Kenneth for
building it.

As it was still fresh when we recorded our previous episode, we talked about some polemic
opinions about Python 3. Kenneth does not like it personally but accepted it as
the Python future, mostly because he liked how strings worked on Python 2.
That was not just an opinion since he told us how he thought would be better to
fix the strings and default encoding issue. Also he thinks that learning Python
3 is a little bit harder since how bytes type works is a little abstract as a
computer science project. Finally, in his opinion, if you are starting a
project today, do it it Python 3.

We also talked about `pipfile`_ which is a project that he is working with
`Donald Stufft`_.  The pipfile is under active development (and design) and there is
no code written so far but the README file shows examples and how it should look like
when implemented. They are doing the project this way to collect feedback from the
community to make sure that they get it right!

The final thing we talked about was `Kenneth's music`_, specially his first
album published, `Unmastered Impulses`_, which "contains tracks inspired by
esoteric spiritual and philosophical concepts, explorations into the dream
state, `bipolar disorder`_, and a `traumatic relationship`_". Kenneth talked
about his passion for music, how he got started and what inspired him to
create the album. The conversation continued and he also commented about how he
built the album artwork. To close this conversation, we talked about Kenneth's
synthesizers and the music live streams he does on Facebook.

We had a great chat with Kenneth and in the end we sked him for his Top 5
recommendations for books, music, and movies.
