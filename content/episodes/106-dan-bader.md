Olá pessoal e sejam bem-vindos à mais um episódio do Castálio Podcast!

Nosso convidado de hoje se intitula "a complete python nut", gosta de cozinhar
comida vegetariana, é o autor do livro [Python
Tricks](https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/), recentemente se
tornou o mantenedor do site <http://pep8.org>, publicou vários vídeos
excelentes no YouTube, e, se não fosse o bastante, ele iniciou um projeto
chamado [PythonistaCafe](https://www.pythonistacafe.com/)! É com grande prazer
que nos recebemos nosso convidado, [Dan Bader](https://dbader.org).

Our guest for today's episode calls himself "a complete python nut", likes to
cook vegetarian food, is the author of the book [Python
Tricks](https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/), just recently took
over the maintainership for the site <http://pep8.org/>, has a ton of great
videos on Youtube, and, as if this wasn't enough, he started a new project
called [PythonistaCafe](https://www.pythonistacafe.com/)! It is with great
pleasure that we welcome our guest, [Dan Bader](https://dbader.org).

<div class="clearfix"></div>

We went through the following topics:

- How did he get started with computers?
- How did he get started with Python?
- What he likes most on the Python language?
- What led him to write his book, [Python Tricks](https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/)?
- What sets his book apart from other books? In other words, why yet
    another book about Python?
- What tools does he use to write his book? And what tools he uses to
    ease the publishing process?
- A lot of the topics covered in Dan\'s book [Python
    Tricks](https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/) have been shared
    as videos on YouTube for free and he has a considerable following on
    YouTube. What led him to share this content with the public?
- Speaking of YouTube content, your videos are, in our humble opinion,
    really well put together and their content are always easy to follow and
    understand. How much time do you spend creating content for YouTube?
- What tools does he use for video editing and recording?
- What does he think about the future of Python?
- Are there some other courses or training material that he has
    developed.
- Just recently he started a new project called
    [PythonistaCafe](https://www.pythonistacafe.com/), which sounds like a
    great combination (Python + coffee). He has described it as: "an
    invite-only, online community of Python and software development
    enthusiasts helping each other succeed and grow." What is this project and
    what his goals are?
- What does he like to do while not writing a great book, creating
    great courses and releasing great videos? In other words, what he like to
    do while not in front of the PC?
