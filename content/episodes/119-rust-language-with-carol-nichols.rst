Olá pessoal e sejam bem-vindos à mais um episódio do Castálio Podcast!

Today, we are going to be talking about one of the new programming languages
that have attracted attention from programmers and companies around the world.
Presented by `Mozilla Research`_ as a "Safe, Practical and Concurrent" solution
and with the promise of solving known systems programming problems, `Rust`_ is
also a multi-paradigm and multi-purpose language. And we'll learn more about
`Rust`_ with `Carol Nichols`_ one of its core-developers and author of
`The Rust Programming Language`_ book.

Discussed topics
================

1) What is `Rust`_, Why does it exist? and how does it compare with other systems
   programming languages such as C++, D and Go?

2) To ensure memory safety, avoid segmentation faults and race conditions,
   Rust brings a new level of complexity with the new concerns regarding
   lifetimes, `Ownership and Borrowing`_. How to explain that stuff in an easy
   way?

3) The plans to add syntax sugars to make writing Rust code easier.

4)  The `Cargo`_ package manager and the challenges of maintaining `crates.io`_
    repository.

5) The diversity of packages available on `crates.io`_

6) Some Rust pitfalls as the lack of learning resources for beginners and the
   long time taken to compile + the size of the binaries.

7) Rust Market Share, `who is using`_ and what are the known use cases.

8) What is missing on Rust to hit the same popularity and adoption as Go?

9) How to get started with `Rust`_?

10) The future and what is coming from the `impl period`_?
