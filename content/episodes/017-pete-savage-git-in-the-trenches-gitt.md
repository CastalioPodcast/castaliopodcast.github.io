First off I\'d like to welcome all the new visitors to this podcast\'s
**17th episode** and the very **first one** done in **English**! This
podcast was born out of my curiosity of getting to know a bit more about
the people I have met, whether in person or online, and go beyond the
superficial information about them. So instead of just talking about
what I already knew, I wanted to focus on what I didn\'t know\... things
such, what type of music they like to listen to, or what type of movies
and books they enjoy\... the history behind their decisions to start or
join their current enterprises and really get a behind the scenes
glimpse of all the factors that shaped this person to what he/she is
now! Up until now I have only catered to the **Brazilian Open Source**
community and all prior episodes have been recorded in Brazilian
Portuguese. When I asked my listeners if they would be interested in an
episode in English with someone new and exciting, the answer was an
overwhelming \'**Yes**!\'

So for my very first episode in English I chose to interview a good
friend of mine from several years: **Pete Savage**! During the next 58
minutes we talked about how we first met through a **PyGtk** video he
posted a while back during a **Linux User Group** meeting, how he first
got involved with **Edubuntu**, and then moved on to several other
projects such as **ProgBox** and **GeekDeck**, about the books that
he\'s written including the reason for writing \"**Emblem Divide**\",
how much the **Japanese culture** plays a role in his daily life, and
his **Top 5** movies, books and movies! A transcript of this episode can
be found
