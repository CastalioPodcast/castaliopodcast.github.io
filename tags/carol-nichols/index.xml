Today, we are going to be talking about one of the new programming languages that have attracted attention from programmers and companies around the world. Presented by Mozilla Research as a &amp;quot;Safe, Practical and Concurrent&amp;quot; solution and with the promise of solving known systems programming problems, Rust is also a multi-paradigm and multi-purpose language.
